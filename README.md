# First GitHub Repository

Hello world!

Welcome to my first GitHub repository. My name is Jay Sueno. Join this journey into the discovery of data science. 

Purpose-driven and motivated to solve some of the world biggest challenges in climate change and equality. I will use technology mixed with environmentalism, ethics, and humanities to achieve my goals.
